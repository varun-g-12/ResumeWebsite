## Projects

### BrAIn (Breeze AI Navigator)
**GenAI Chatbot** | April 2023 - Feb 2024

Developed an AI chatbot with access to Breeze SOPs and training documents, supported by an automated data ingestion pipeline using AWS Lambda, S3, and SharePoint. Leveraging Azure OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model and Qdrant DB, we built a vector store for efficient document retrieval. The chatbot's interface was created using Streamlit with a Python and Langchain backend, incorporating multi-vector retrieval for parent-child document relationships and context-aware conversations using router and question reframe chains. Powered by the GPT-4o model, the chatbot delivers accurate responses with a citation system providing page-level references from source documents.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Azure OpenAI, Qdrant, Streamlit, Langchain, SharePoint, AWS, Lambda, S3

### PACO (Protocol Analysis for Complexity Optimisation)
**GenAI Data Extraction App** | Dec 2023 - March 2024

Developed an AI-powered application to extract structured data from unstructured Word and PDF documents, featuring a document processing pipeline using PyMuPDF and the Unstructured library. The application included a user-friendly Streamlit interface for document uploading and result downloading. Custom system prompts were engineered for various extraction tasks, including JSON schema specifications, and Langchain's structured output function ensured consistent JSON-formatted results. Powered by the GPT-4o model for high-accuracy information extraction, the app implemented a batch processing system to parallelize tasks and improve efficiency. Additionally, we developed a conversion process to transform extracted JSON data into a downloadable Excel format for easy user review.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Langchain, Streamlit, PyMuPDF, Unstructured, GPT-4o, JSON, Excel

### GRD (Global Response Document)
**GenAI Summarisation App** | Aug 2024-Oct 2025

Developed an AI-powered application to generate Global Response Documents (GRDs) for healthcare professionals, reducing the GRD creation time from 3–4 hours to just 10–20 minutes. The solution included a document preprocessing pipeline using PyMuPDF for text extraction and AWS Textract for table extraction. Tailored system prompts were created based on user-selected Therapeutic Area (TA), product, and GRD type, while a batch processing system enabled efficient multi-page document handling. Using a single-shot prompting approach, the application maintained a scientific tone and format. Integrated with the GPT-4o model via Langchain for both data extraction and summarization, the app featured a Streamlit-based user interface for easy interaction and document uploading. It also provided a citation system for page-level references and generated output in downloadable Word format for seamless distribution and editing.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Langchain, Streamlit, PyMuPDF, AWS Textract, GPT-4o

### MiNE MCP
**MCP setup for MiNE (exploration)** | Aug-2025 - Present

Takenup the MCP server setup for MiNE project as exploration/POC task.

**Tech Stack:** MCP, LLM Agents, AWS

### Text to SQL Conversational App
**POC** | 2023-2024

Developed a proof-of-concept application enabling natural language queries on Foundry data tables, featuring a conversational AI system using the GPT-4o model and Langgraph for agentic workflows. A SQL query agent was designed to convert natural language inputs into accurate SQL queries, supported by a custom tool to execute these queries on Foundry tables and retrieve relevant data. An answer agent analyzed query results and generated human-readable responses. The application included a Streamlit-based interface for seamless user interaction, integrating table schema information and custom system prompts to improve query accuracy and enhance data accessibility through natural language interaction.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Langgraph, Streamlit, GPT-4o, SQL, Foundry

### MiNE
**Report generation tool** | Oct 2025 - Present

Built an AI-powered tool that automatically creates reports by gathering information from multiple sources (social media, scientific articles, and medical data). Designed a two-step process: first, the system extracts key information from user questions to quickly filter through millions of database records; second, it uses smart retrieval methods to find the most relevant data and generate accurate reports.

**Tech Stack:** Foundry, Qdrant, Langchain, Streamlit, RAG
