# ResumeWebsite

## What You Want to Build

**Goal:** Turn a resume (stored in a `resume` folder) into a beautiful website and publish it online using GitHub Pages.

**Key Points:**
- The resume is for a Python/GenAI developer position
- The website design should match this tech-focused profile (modern, professional, tech-savvy look)
- I want the final result to be visually impressive and stand out
- I am leaving all technical decisions (frameworks, tools, design choices) up to you since I am not familiar with UI development
- The website will be hosted for free on GitHub Pages
- Need git-actions for automatic deployment
- Always interview me for more clarity
